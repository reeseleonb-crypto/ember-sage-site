      <article className="space-y-6">
        <p>Seasonal clothing and extra bedding spend a surprising amount of time out of sight. Coats, sweaters, blankets, and spare sheets often live in wardrobes or storage bins for months before they are needed again. Without any scent support, those items can emerge smelling like the back of a closet instead of something you want to use right away.</p>

        <p>Cedar sachet bags offer an easy way to keep those tucked away items in better condition. The wood naturally helps manage light moisture in enclosed spaces, which is one of the main reasons fabrics develop stale or dusty odors. At the same time, the chips release a dry, pleasant fragrance that feels appropriate for clothing and linens.</p>

        <p>Hanging a sachet inside a wardrobe keeps long coats and dress clothes from picking up that closed, unused scent between wears. Dropping sachets into plastic bins or boxes filled with blankets or off season outfits means you are greeted by a clean smell instead of stale air when you open them months later.</p>

        <p>Because cedar chips can be refreshed with new essential oils over time, the same sachets can protect multiple seasons worth of storage. A quick top up of fragrance before you close the bins for the year gives them a strong start, and the slow release nature of wood carried scent does the rest.</p>

        <p>These small steps might not feel dramatic day to day, but they add up. When your stored items come out smelling pleasant and ready to use, you spend less time rewashing and more time actually enjoying the things you own.</p>

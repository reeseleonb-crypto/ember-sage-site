      <p className="mb-4">
        Sachets release fragrance differently depending on their environment. Closets have vertical airflowÃ¢â‚¬â€warm air rises, carrying scent upward. Bedrooms have horizontal airflow, spreading fragrance outward through the open space.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In closets, sachets perform best when placed high on a shelf, inside a hanging organizer, or near heavier fabrics that absorb scent slowly. In bedrooms, sachets work well in drawers, under pillows for light aromatherapy, or near warm corners where airflow enhances diffusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enclosed spaces always produce the longest-lasting scent. For strong performance, choose closets. For softer everyday fragrance, bedrooms are ideal.

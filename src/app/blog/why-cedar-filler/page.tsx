        <p>Not all sachet fillers behave the same way once you add fragrance to them. Some look pretty for a short time but lose their scent quickly, while others hold on to essential oils for months. Cedar chips stand out because they do both jobs well. They bring their own gentle aroma to the mix and also act as a long term reservoir for added oils.</p>

        <p>Each piece of cedar is full of tiny pores and grain lines that happily soak up liquid. When you drip essential oils onto the chips, the oil does not just sit on the surface. It travels into the wood fibers, which slows down the rate at which it can escape back into the air. The result is a steady, even release of scent rather than a quick burst followed by nothing.</p>

        <p>Cedar also has a natural fragrance that pairs with many different scent families. Warm spice blends, bright citrus notes, crisp pine, and soothing herbs all sit comfortably on top of that wood base. Instead of competing, the scents layer together and feel like they belong in the same space, which is especially nice in closets and drawers.</p>

        <p>Durability is another reason cedar makes sense as a filler. While dried flowers or paper based fillers eventually crumble or discolor, cedar chips hold their shape use after use. That means you can keep refreshing the same sachet again and again with new oil instead of throwing it away once the first scent fades.</p>

        <p>When you combine longevity, versatility, and a naturally clean smell, cedar becomes an easy choice for high quality sachet bags. It supports the fragrance you choose, stretches the life of each refill, and helps your home smell comfortably fresh without much effort.</p>

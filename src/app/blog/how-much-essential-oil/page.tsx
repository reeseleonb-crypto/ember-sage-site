      <p className="mb-4">
        Most people assume stronger scent comes from adding more oil, but sachets donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t work like candles or diffusers.
        Cedar can only absorb so much before the rest burns off quickly. The right balance is when the chips feel dry to the touch
        but still release fragrance slowly over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        A well-made sachet should never feel oily. If it does, it was over-oiled and will fade faster. The goal is saturation,
        not soaking. When cedar is treated properly, the scent lasts longer and ages naturally instead of evaporating all at once.

        <p>Most people first meet sachet bags in dresser drawers, and then the habit stops there. Drawers are a great place for cedar sachets, but they are only the beginning. Once you start thinking of sachets as tiny portable fresheners, a lot of overlooked spots around the house suddenly make sense for them.</p>

        <p>Living room furniture is a perfect example. Sliding a sachet behind the pillows on a couch or chair lets the scent rise slowly whenever someone sits down or adjusts the cushions. It is a subtle way to keep the main hangout area from picking up stale or dusty odors, especially in homes with pets or kids.</p>

        <p>Sachets also work hard in the places that regularly see sweat or damp fabric. Gym bags, sports gear, backpacks, and shoe storage can all benefit from a small cedar bag tucked into one corner. The chips help absorb unwanted smells while releasing a cleaner, drier scent that does not clash with everything else in the space.</p>

        <p>Travel is another missed opportunity. Packing a sachet in your suitcase or weekender bag helps clothes arrive smelling like your home instead of the inside of a warehouse. After the trip, you can leave the same sachet in the luggage until you need it again, so it is always ready.</p>

        <p>Even storage areas outside the main living space are fair game. A few sachets placed in holiday decoration bins, camping gear totes, or extra bedding boxes make it much nicer to open those containers months later. Anywhere that fabric sits still and air does not move much is a place where a sachet can quietly improve how your home feels.</p>

      <article className="space-y-6">
        <p>Drawers are one of the most personal storage spaces in the home, holding clothes, undergarments, and small everyday items. That is exactly why strong sprays and plug in devices rarely feel like a good fit there. They are either too powerful for such a small space or completely ineffective once the drawer is closed.</p>

        <p>Cedar sachet bags solve that problem by living directly with the fabrics they are meant to freshen. Instead of trying to push scent into a closed area from across the room, they start inside the drawer and gently fill the space from within. The fragrance does not need to be intense to work, because it never has to travel far.</p>

        <p>Sprays can also leave wet spots or marks on certain materials, especially delicate fabrics. With a sachet, the scent moves through the air inside the drawer rather than sitting as a liquid on the clothing. That means you still get a pleasant aroma when you open the drawer, but you do not risk staining your favorite pieces.</p>

        <p>Another advantage is control. If a drawer feels too strongly scented, you can simply move the sachet to a different space for a while. There are no electrical outlets involved and no cartridges to unplug. Over time, the drawer maintains a steady background freshness that makes clean clothes feel even more cared for.</p>

        <p>In the long run, drawer sachets provide better results because they match how the space is actually used. They work quietly in the background every day, keeping frequently opened drawers from picking up that closed, stale smell that is so common in busy homes.</p>

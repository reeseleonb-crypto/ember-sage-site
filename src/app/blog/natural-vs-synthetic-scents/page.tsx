        <p className="mb-4">
          Many people are moving away from synthetic air fresheners because they are tired of strong
          chemical smells that only last a few minutes. Natural scents—especially ones made with cedar,
          dried botanicals, and essential oils—work differently.

        <p className="mb-4">
          They release aroma slowly and steadily, creating a clean scent that blends into daily life
          without overwhelming the space.

          alternative to synthetic sprays and plug-ins.

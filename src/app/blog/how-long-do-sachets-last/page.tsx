        <p className="mb-4">
          Sachet bags usually stay fresh for 4–8 weeks depending on the materials used and where you place

          Many people rotate their sachets seasonally. Others refresh them based on how frequently a space
          is used—gym bags and cars naturally need more attention than dresser drawers.

          Even when the scent fades, natural ingredients like cedar continue helping with odor control.
          At that point, most people replace or refresh their sachets as needed.

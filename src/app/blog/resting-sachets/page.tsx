      <p className="mb-4">
        High-quality sachets go through a resting periodÃ¢â‚¬â€usually 24 to 72 hoursÃ¢â‚¬â€after oils are added. This stage dramatically improves scent longevity and smoothness. During this time, essential oils bind to the cedar fibers rather than sitting on the surface.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Resting also softens sharp top notes, stabilizes moisture levels, and balances multi-oil blends into a cohesive aroma. Skipping this step leads to fast-fading, overly strong sachets that don&apos;t age well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a sachet smells better after a day or two, it&apos;s working exactly as it should. Resting is a key part of the craft that separates quick-made sachets from long-lasting ones.

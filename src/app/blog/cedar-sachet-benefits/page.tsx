        <p className="mb-4">
          Cedar sachet bags work differently from candles or sprays. Instead of giving off a strong scent
          that fades quickly, cedar absorbs odors naturally and releases a clean, woodsy aroma that never
          feels artificial.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Cedar has been used in closets and chests for generations because its natural oils help fabrics
          stay fresh. A cedar sachet bag brings that same benefit into modern spaces—drawers, linen cabinets,
          seasonal bins, suitcases, and even gym bags.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          One of the biggest advantages is how well cedar handles that closed-up smell that happens in small,
          enclosed spaces. People often use sachets with guest bedding or seasonal clothes so everything stays
          fresh between uses.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">
          If you want a cleaner-smelling home without chemicals or overpowering fragrances, cedar sachet
          bags are one of the simplest and most reliable tools you can add.

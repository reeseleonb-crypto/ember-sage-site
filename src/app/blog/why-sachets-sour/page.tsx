      <p className="mb-4">
        Cheap sachets often turn sour because synthetic fragrance reacts to heat, humidity, and fabric fibers. Paper filler
        also traps moisture and changes scent molecules over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cedar-based sachets avoid this entirely. Natural cedar resists moisture and strengthens oils instead of breaking them down.
        ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s why cedar trunks still smell clean decades laterÃ¢â‚¬â€nature built the preservative right into the wood.

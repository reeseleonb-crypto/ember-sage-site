      <p className="mb-4">
        Handmade sachets rely on natural materials and slow methods. Cedar is sifted, treated, and rested with oils before bagging.
        Each batch is blended by hand, not sprayed on a factory line.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a sachet that ages gracefully instead of burning out. When materials matter more than volume, the fragrance feels
        cleaner, calmer, and far more consistent over time.

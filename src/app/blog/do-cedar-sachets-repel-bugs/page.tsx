      <p className="mb-4">
        Cedar has been trusted for centuries to protect clothing and stored goods. Its natural oils contain compounds like cedrol and thujone that disrupt insect scent receptors, making the environment less appealing to moths and fabric pests.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cedar sachets do not kill insects, but they do discourage moths and beetles from settling in closets or drawers. This makes them an effective, natural alternative to chemical mothballsÃ¢â‚¬â€especially for wool or cotton storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        For best results, place cedar sachets near folded clothing, on shelves, or inside garment bags. Their steady aroma creates a passive layer of protection without harsh chemicals or overpowering perfumes.

      <article className="space-y-6">
        <p>Dried flower blends look beautiful in jars and bowls, but they are not built for long term fragrance. Petals and thin leaves have very little structure to hold onto oils. When you add essential oil to them, they release a strong smell at first and then slip quickly toward being scentless decorations.</p>

        <p>Cedar chips work differently because of their density and internal grain. Each chip has enough thickness to absorb oil into its core rather than simply coating the outside. That absorbed oil is released slowly over time, which turns cedar into a dependable background scent rather than a brief burst.</p>

        <p>Another challenge with pure botanical mixes is durability. With handling, the delicate pieces break down, crumble, and lose their color. In a sachet that is meant to be moved between drawers, suitcases, or bins, that fragility becomes a real drawback. Cedar chips, on the other hand, can handle regular handling without falling apart.</p>

        <p>There is also the matter of how the scent pairs with everyday life. Dried flowers can sometimes lean too sweet or perfumed, especially in small spaces. Cedar brings a drier, more grounded note that feels clean beside clothing, towels, and bedding. When essential oils are layered onto it, the result is more balanced and easier to live with.</p>

        <p>For sachets that are meant to be used rather than simply admired, cedar offers better performance on every front. It holds essential oils longer, stands up to repeated use, and delivers a fragrance profile that fits naturally into closets, drawers, and storage spaces.</p>

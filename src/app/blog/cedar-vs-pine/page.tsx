      <p className="mb-4">
        Cedar and pine both create warm, woodsy aromas, but they behave very differently once essential oils are added. Cedar chips have a porous internal structure that absorbs oils deeply and releases fragrance slowly over time. This is why cedar-lined closets continue smelling pleasant for decades.

      <p className="mb-4">
        Pine shavings smell bright and clean at first, but they cannot hold scent as long because their cell structure is thinner and less absorbent. Pine releases fragrance quickly and fades quickly unless it&apos;s paired with stronger base oils.

        For long-lasting sachets, cedar is the superior filler. Pine can add a refreshing note, but cedar provides the stability, longevity, and natural resistance to moisture that high-quality sachet bags rely on.

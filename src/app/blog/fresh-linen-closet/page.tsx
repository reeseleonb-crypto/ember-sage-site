        <p>Linen closets work hard but do not get much attention. Towels, sheets, and blankets move in and out week after week, and in between they sit in a closed, often slightly humid space. Without any help, that is a recipe for linens that smell flat or musty even when they are technically clean.</p>

        <p>Adding cedar sachet bags to the closet changes that routine in a simple way. The wood chips quietly absorb bits of moisture in the air and replace it with a dry, clean fragrance that moves through the folded stacks. Placing one sachet on each shelf ensures that every layer of towels or sheets gets some of that benefit instead of only the top or bottom.</p>

        <p>Placement matters here too. Keeping sachets near the front edges of shelves lets air move around them whenever the door is opened, which gently lifts the scent back through the space. If your closet is deep, you can tuck one sachet toward the back as well to keep the far corners from going stale.</p>

        <p>Refreshing the sachets a few times a year with new drops of essential oil is usually enough to keep the closet smelling like freshly washed linens instead of closed storage. Many people like to coordinate scents with the seasons, choosing brighter notes in warm months and richer blends during colder weather.</p>

        <p>When your linen closet smells good, it does more than just make doing laundry a little nicer. It also means every towel and sheet you pull from the shelf carries a hint of that freshness, which quietly improves how the rest of the house feels.</p>

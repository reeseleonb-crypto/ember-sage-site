      <p className="mb-4">
        Drawer odor usually comes from the wood inside the furnitureÃ¢â‚¬â€not from clothing. Wood absorbs humidity, detergent residue, and scents from previous storage. Over time, these compounds create a stale or musty smell.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Cedar sachets naturally address this problem. Cedar contains aromatic compounds called thujaplicins that neutralize unwanted odors inside enclosed spaces. As cedar releases its own clean scent, it balances out the aged aroma of drawer wood.

      <p>
        Unlike synthetic fresheners that simply mask odors, cedar interacts with the drawer itself, improving the long-term scent of the space and keeping clothing fresher without chemicals.

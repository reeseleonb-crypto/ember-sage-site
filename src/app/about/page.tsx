        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Ember & Sage was created with a simple purpose: to bring warmth, comfort, and natural
          fragrance back into the spaces we live in. Each sachet is handmade in small batches,
          crafted with real cedar chips, dried botanicals, and clean essential oil blends that
          deliver a scent experience rooted in nature.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          We focus on rustic simplicity. No artificial perfumes, no fillers, and no mass production.
          Every scent begins with real ingredients‚ cedar, orange peel, rosemary, clove‚ and more, and is paired
          with a thoughtfully blended essential oil profile that enhances the natural aroma without
          overpowering it.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          Whether it is a drawer, closet, car, or gift, each sachet is made to feel personal. The
          warmth of a cabin fire, the freshness of clean linens in the sun, the quiet stillness of a
          pine forest‚ these are the feelings we bottle inside every bag.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Thank you for supporting handmade goods, small-batch craftsmanship, and a brand built on
          simple, natural comfort.
        </p>
